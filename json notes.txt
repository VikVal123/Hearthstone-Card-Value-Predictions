#Example #1

#When opening files we also need to close them.

f = open('filename', 'r')

print(f.name) 
#Name will only print out the file name. 
#Instead of name you can use mode. Mode will show you
#mode that the files is currently open with. In this 
#situaton it would be r that stand for read.

f.close()

#Example #2

#If we open a file as per above it is important to 
#explicitly close the file. If you forget to close the
#file it will only get you unecessary errors. By using 
#context manager we can easily avoid this with "with".
#This method allows us to work with files within a
#block of code. Once it is done it will it will automaticaly
#close the block of code once used.




r = read file
a = append file
r+ = read and append file
